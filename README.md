The platform is build on top of IronFish -- a L1 blockchain which preserves transactions anonymity by utilizing ZKP technology.

For each donation, a one-time use disposable IronFish account is used, which allows to preserve the transaction anonymity. The funds then are automatically transferred to the Company address on IronFish.

Both Donors and Campaign managers are able to export and share ðŸ”‘ View-Only Keys, allowing anyone else to view the details of the donation transactions. This helps verify the legitimacy of the source of funds.

Once the Campaign is over, the owner has the option to utilize the bridge in the opposite direction, effectively transferring all campaign funds back onto the Ethereum blockchain, if desired
